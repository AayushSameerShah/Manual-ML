# Hey man! We've reached to the start of something exciting!

This has been a **quite long** time to be here and experiment new things. Honestly, this journey brought me to learn many new things. I started implementing the freakin' ML algorithms from scratch! From simple python code! Of course yes, they are not optimized nor they are sufficient to be scaled — but I don't care. I have implemented a *mind* which can think. If I learn the data structures and algorithms I can make my algorithms better!

Anyways, if you are someone other than me — many times I referred a term "Book" by which I mean the amazing book from [Jason Brownlee]() - "Master ML Algorithms".

### My Review

The book actually has planted a *new seed* in me. It is "I can develop the ML algorithm from scratch, it is not hard if you make things in your words". Before taking this book I had used the algorithms. As said ***used*** only. That time I was used to get afraid to see how it worked because of my prejudice of them being *scary*. But here, this time the author has not only talked about how things work but also presented in the simple terms that I as a starter can understand, generalize it and make it my own.

He presented in the form of spreadsheet. All the steps were done entirely in the spreadsheet so I had to understand it and had to implement in the python. Which was quite amazing. *If I were to start it now, I would have done better code, but okay!*

Now man, I am more confident to discuss what is happening inside of an algorithm than before. It is just a start of another story. Now I have to do more.

Nextly, I am going to start building the **Stats** intuation. I have learnt stats in my 10th, 11th and 12th. I will revisit and re-note each fundamentals in my notebook. I guess this time, the notebook will be physical ans so it will not be on GitHub.

# Exciting!

If you are someone other than me, I want to thank you for reading my stuff. I don't know why I followed this style of explaining, but if you found it handy and *guidy* I am really happy for that. And yes, Aayush see you there in the next exciting story.
