# Hey, Man!
Glad to see you back here! It's been a long time since we have written a piece of code and document them here after completing `Pandas_book` ← hah, I like that.

### Here?
This is a quick welcome guide in the shortest word possible to get you fimiliar with what this is all about. Because you know, you may come here after a long time and it will be easier for you to figure out how to approach this whole section.

### How is all spreaded?
This repository is not intended to be like a page-by-page documenting things like I did in Pandas_book. But this time the thing is little different.

Here as the book suggests... wait, which book is it? <br>
 *presenting*
# Master ML Algorithms

So, this book is all about HOW THE ALGORITHMS are built, in the simplest language — man! I needed this. It is the book in which we can see the working algorithm from the line by line perspective. I have used the algos but never knew HOW. Now it is the chance that I can get fimiliar with those algos.

continuing... This book it self has very intuative and simple wordings that I might not have to explain them here. But to keep things handy and for the sake of **tried-out-myself**, I am developing this repository so that you can refer to any algoritham whenever you want.

This repository is easy to nevigate. I have not written any simple things and explanations like what regression is... but I have included my comments on the process in the book itself. 

Here I will be providing the codes in Python. Of course.

Let's have fun and get confident with ML!
